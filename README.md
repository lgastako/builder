# builder

Builder is a web-based tool to help you build the reality you want out of the
reality you have.

The idea is that you can create cards(?) that describe things you want to be
true about your reality and then track the differences between the way things
really are and the way you want them to be over time.

The idea is that builder will guide you in your attempt to bring about the
changes necessary to forge the reality you wish to live in.

A simple example might be something like a card that says "I want to reach my
ideal weight of xx lbs."

To be continued.
